What is charAt()?

The charAt() method is a fundamental string method in JavaScript that allows you to access the character at a specific index (position) within a string. 
Think of a string as an ordered sequence of characters, and charAt() lets you pick out one of those characters based on its place in the sequence.

Syntax in JavaScript:

string.charAt(index)

string: This is the string you want to work with. It can be a string literal (e.g., "hello") or a string variable.
index: This is a non-negative integer representing the position of the character you want to retrieve.
The indexing in JavaScript strings (and many other programming languages) is zero-based. This means the first character of the string is at index 0, the second character is at index 1, and so on.

Code examples:

const str = "hello";
console.log(str.charAt(0));   // Output: "h"
console.log(str.charAt(4));   // Output: "o"
console.log(str.charAt(5));   // Output: "" (out of bounds)
console.log(str.charAt(-1));  // Output: "h" (negative index treated as 0)
.
